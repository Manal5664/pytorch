#  PyTorch Tensors — Colab Notebook

This repository contains my **PyTorch practice notebook** created in **Google Colab**, focused on learning and experimenting with **tensors** — the core building blocks of PyTorch.

---

## 📘 **Overview**

In this notebook, I explored how tensors work in PyTorch and compared their behavior and performance on **CPU vs GPU**.  
The notebook covers:

- 🔹 Creating tensors  
- 🔹 Tensor shapes and dimensions  
- 🔹 Mathematical operations  
- 🔹 Element-wise operations  
- 🔹 Reduction operations (sum, mean, etc.)  
- 🔹 Comparison operators  
- 🔹 Spatial functions  
- 🔹 In-place operations  
- 🔹 Copying tensors  
- 🔹 Checking tensor and matrix size  
- 🔹 Reshaping (ring-shaping) tensors  
- 🔹 Working with **NumPy ↔ PyTorch** conversion  
- 🔹 Performance comparison between **CPU and GPU**

## ⚙️ **Environment**

- **Platform:** Google Colab  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Library:** PyTorch (`torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`)

## 🚀 **Highlights**

- Compared tensor operations on CPU and GPU to observe **speed differences**  
- Demonstrated **in-place vs out-of-place operations**  
- Showed how to **convert NumPy arrays into PyTorch tensors** and back  
- Visualized tensor properties like shape, size, and device type

## 💻 **How to Run**

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  
2. Run all cells to explore PyTorch tensor operations.  
3. (Optional) Switch runtime to GPU to see performance comparison.
